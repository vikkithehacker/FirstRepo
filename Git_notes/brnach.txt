<!> Create Git Branch without switching:-


"In order to create a new Git branch, without switching to this new branch, you have to use the “git branch” command and specify the name of the Git branch to be created."

$ git branch <branch_name>



"You can later on switch to your new Git branch by using the “git checkout” function."

$ git checkout <branch_name>



"Going back to our previous example, let’s say that you want to create a branch named “feature”."

$ git branch feature



"You can inspect existing branches by running the “git branch” command with the “-a” option for all branches."

$ git branch -a

Awesome, you have successfully created a new Git branch and you switched to it using the checkout command.



<!> Create Git branch using checkout:--

"The easiest way to create a Git branch is to use the “git checkout” command with the “-b” option for a new branch. Next, you just have to specify the name for the branch you want to create."

$ git checkout -b <branch-name>



"As an example, let’s say that you want to create a new Git branch from the master branch named “feature”.
To achieve that, you will run the “git checkout” command with the “-b” option and add “feature” as the branch name.

$ git checkout -b feature

Switched to new branch 'feature'
As you can see, by using the “git checkout” command, you are creating a new branch and you are switching to this new branch automatically.


<!> How to delete a Git branch locally and remotely:--

<!> Deleting a branch LOCALLY:--

Git will not let you delete the branch you are currently on so you must make sure to checkout a branch that you are NOT deleting. For example: git checkout main

$ git branch -d <branch>.
For example: git branch -d branchA

The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch. Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet.
The branch is now deleted locally.


<!> Deleting a branch REMOTELY:-

Here's the command to delete a branch remotely:

$ git push <remote> --delete <branch>.
For example: git push origin --delete branchA

The branch is now deleted remotely.



"You can also use this shorter command to delete a branch remotely." 

$ git push <remote> :<branch>
For example: git push origin :branchA

If you get the error below, it may mean that someone else has already deleted the branch.
